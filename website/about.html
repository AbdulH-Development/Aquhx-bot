                    I am a developer who enjoys making discord bots in python.<br>

                    For further questions please contact me.<br><br>

                    <b>MORE INFO</b><br><br>

                    I also like aviation, and have loved it since I was 5,<br>
                    around then I would grab model planes which I didn't know<br>
                    aren't ment to be played with and would throw them all over the my room<br>
                    and take off their different parts.<br><br>

                    I also like space a lot and love the SpaceX rockets,<br>
                    my favorite rockets are the Falcon Heavy, Falcon 9, SLS, and that's all.<br>
                    My favorite planet is Jupiter because it's mysterious and you can't stand on it<br>
                    because it doesn't have a surface.<br><br>

                    I also like history and have studied it a lot<br>
                    I know a lot about WWI and WWII and the crusades.<br>
                    I mainly studied the history of Egypt tho, because that's where I'm from.<br><br>

                    I also have dog named Tiny who loves to bark and bite people.
